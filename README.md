# Sahara Cafe & Beans
Welcome to Sahara Cafe & Beans:

a django-python project by ***Bryar Osman***

The Sahara Cafe & Beans project is a web-based application developed by me Bryar Osman, as part of a school django-python project. It aims to provide an online platform for a cafeteria where customers can sign up, sign in, create profile, view the menu, book/reserve a table with full CRUD functionality for both profile as wel as their reservations.

## Introduction
The website of Sahara Cafe & Beans Cafeteria can be viewd by any custumers. If customers wants to reserve a table, customers can do so if customer sign up and sign in. after filling the sign up form, the customer will get an email with a link to verify their email. The link will redirect the user to the website to confirm their registeration. user can then sign in and create a reservation if they wants to. user will automatically have an profile with default porifle image already filled with their informations when they signed up. the user can change their phone, address and email. But for the email they will guided with a button "change email" if they want to change, they will then get a verfication link to verify the new email. If they create reservation or cancel reservation they will get an instance confirmation if reservation is not double booked, they will alsi get an email confirmation about their rservation or cancelation. user can also delete account and profile if they wish, and if they do that they will be notificed that their reservations will all be canceled. The admin can via admin add menu and menu details. plan is to upgrade so that staff can log in via website instead of admin panel.
